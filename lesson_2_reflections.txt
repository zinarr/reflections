What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

    A .git subdirectory is created to hold repository metadata.  It is
    required because the directory will not otherwise be recognized as a
    git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository?  What value do you think it offers?

   The staging area holds files which have been added but not yet committed.
   The staging area makes it easier to group files comprising a single logical
   change into a single commit, without committing changes for an unrelated
   task.
