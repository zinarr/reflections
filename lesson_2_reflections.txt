What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

    A .git subdirectory is created to hold repository metadata.  It is
    required because the directory will not otherwise be recognized as a
    git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository?  What value do you think it offers?

   The staging area holds files which have been added but not yet committed.
   The staging area makes it easier to group files comprising a single logical
   change into a single commit, without committing changes for an unrelated
   task.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

   Use "git add" to add only those file(s) which comprise the logical change
   to the staging area, then run "git commit" to commit those files to the
   repository as a single unit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized?  How would branches help?

   For coding an experimental feature or testing an alternate algorithm,
   branches would be helpful.  They allow you to avoid "contaminating" the
   master branch with a possibly large set of changes which may ultimately
   not be used in the final version.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

   The diagrams allow you to see the commit at which a branch was created,
   and which commits are associated with which branches.

What is the result of merging two branches together?  Why do we represent it
in the diagram the way we do?

   The result is a file which combines the contents of the files represented
   by the two branches.  We represent it in the diagram as one branch merging
   into another (the current branch) because that's what is happening.
