When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It makes collaboration with others possible.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Having git pull automatically might interfere with changes you are
    still working on in your local copy of the repository (especially if
    the changes are on the master branch)

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is basically a clone of a GitHub repository, but onto the
    GitHub server.  A clone creates a copy of a GitHub repository onto
    your local computer.  A branch is created on your local computer, and
    is used to establish a separate line of development for new features
    or bug fixes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
